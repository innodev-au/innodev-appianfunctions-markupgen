function.markupgen_html_newrawpart.description=Produces an HTML part, taking the value as raw; i.e., no character escaping is performed. Use this function only when strictly necessary. Where possible, use markupGen_html_newElem instead. To convert HTML elements to text, including raw HTML, use markupGen_html_toText. IMPORTANT: the internal value returned by this function is to be treated as an opaque value: it's not meant to be used directly and may change in a future version of this plugin.
function.markupgen_html_newrawpart.param.rawHtml.description=Raw HTML content
